### **Explanation of Key Concepts in the Code:**

---

### **What is `Depends`?**
- **What it is:** `Depends` is a utility provided by FastAPI to declare dependencies for a route handler.
- **How it works:** 
  - It allows injecting reusable logic (e.g., database sessions, authentication checks, etc.) into route handlers.
  - In the given code, `Depends(get_session)` is used to provide a session to the `create_blog` endpoint without manually managing the session lifecycle.
- **Purpose:** Simplifies dependency injection and ensures better modularity and cleaner code.

---

### **What is `Session`?**
- **What it is:** `Session` is a class from `sqlmodel` (built on top of SQLAlchemy) used to interact with the database.
- **How it works:**
  - It acts as a connection to the database and provides methods to perform operations like querying, adding, committing, and rolling back transactions.
- **Role in the code:** It is used to interact with the database when creating or modifying data.

---

### **What is `engine`?**
- **What it is:** `engine` is a SQLAlchemy `Engine` object, which manages the database connection.
- **How it works:**
  - It encapsulates the connection details, such as the database URL, and handles creating connections to the database as needed.
- **Role in the code:** It is passed to `Session` and `SQLModel` for establishing connections and performing database operations.

---

### **What is `SQLModel`?**
- **What it is:** `SQLModel` is a Python ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) library built on top of SQLAlchemy.
- **How it works:**
  - It allows you to define database tables as Python classes and interact with the database using these models.
  - Models inherit from `SQLModel`, and the library generates SQL queries behind the scenes.
- **Role in the code:** `BlogModel` is a subclass of `SQLModel`, representing a database table.

---

### **What is `SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)`?**
- **What it does:** 
  - It creates database tables based on the `SQLModel` models defined in the code.
- **How it works:**
  - `SQLModel.metadata` contains the schema definitions for all the models.
  - `create_all(engine)` generates the SQL commands (like `CREATE TABLE`) and executes them against the connected database.
- **Role in the code:** Ensures all required tables are created when the application starts.

---

### **What does the code below do?**
```python
with Session(engine) as session:
    yield session
```
- **What it does:** 
  - Creates a session (database connection) tied to the `engine`, ensuring proper resource management.
  - The `yield` keyword makes it a generator, allowing FastAPI to use this function as a dependency.
  - Once the session is used, it is automatically closed after the request is processed.
- **How it works:**
  - `with Session(engine)` manages the session lifecycle, opening and closing the connection safely.
  - The `yield` statement provides the session to the endpoint logic.

---

### **What is `on_event` and `"startup"`?**
- **What it is:** `@app.on_event("startup")` is a FastAPI event hook for performing actions when the application starts.
- **How it works:**
  - The `"startup"` event is triggered when the FastAPI app starts running.
  - The decorated function (`on_startup`) runs during this event.
- **Role in the code:**
  - Ensures the database tables are created before any endpoint is accessed by calling `create_db_and_tables()`.

---

### **Why is `"Z"` added in the front-end API endpoint?**
- **What it is:** `"Z"` represents "Zulu time," another name for UTC time, as per ISO 8601 format.
- **How it works:**
  - When the front-end sends a timestamp, it often uses UTC (coordinated universal time) for consistency across time zones.
  - `"Z"` signifies that the timestamp is in UTC.
- **Role in the code:** The `created_at` field is converted from an ISO 8601 string (with `"Z"`) to a Python `datetime` object using:
  ```python
  blog.created_at = datetime.datetime.fromisoformat(blog.created_at.replace("Z", "+00:00"))
  ```
  This replaces `"Z"` with the timezone offset `+00:00`.

---

### **What does the following code do?**
```python
session.add(blog)
session.commit()
session.refresh(blog)
```
- **`session.add(blog)`**
  - Adds the `blog` object to the database session, marking it for insertion into the database.
- **`session.commit()`**
  - Commits the transaction, saving the changes (e.g., inserting the blog) permanently into the database.
- **`session.refresh(blog)`**
  - Reloads the `blog` object from the database to update it with any changes made during the commit (e.g., auto-generated fields like `id`).
- **Role of `session`:** 
  - Manages the transaction lifecycle and database operations.
  - Ensures safe and consistent interaction with the database.
